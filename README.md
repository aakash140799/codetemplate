# codetemplate
necessary algorithms and data-structures implemented as classes or functions


1) to use code, follow comments in code
2) //define xyz// means xyz is present in other file in repository;
    either search for file, and copy code, or use stl
    e.g. // define graph// means copy code from graph.cpp and create data-instance of name- graph;
3) some data instance are of type "type". change them to the type you want to use;
4) some files require some functions to be defined by functionality required given in comments.
   these functionalities are type-dependent, hence need to be defined by user;
